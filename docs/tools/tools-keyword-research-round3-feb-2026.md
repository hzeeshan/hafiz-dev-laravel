## KEY INSIGHTS FROM ROUND 3 RESEARCH

### Competitor analysis approach works but requires validation:
goonlinetools.com has 250+ tools, but **blindly copying their tool list would be a mistake**. Most of their high-volume tools (font generators, random generators, lookup tools) are Hard KD. They likely built authority over years of compounding. The BUILD framework (Easy KD + >100 volume) correctly filtered out the noise.

### Category-level findings:

1. **Platform font generators are mostly a bust** — Discord, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook all Hard or Medium KD. Only LinkedIn is Easy (smaller, more professional niche). The big font generator sites (LingoJam, FontGet) dominate these SERPs.

2. **Fee calculators are the best new category** — Stripe and Etsy are both Easy KD with >1,000 volume. These target a founder/seller audience (aligns with 30% founder content strategy). Also natural CTA fit for MVP services.

3. **Random generators are oversaturated** — Only random emoji generator passed (Easy, >1,000). Everything else (number, color, letter, word, name, yes/no) is Hard KD. Google's own random tools dominate many of these.

4. **Lookup/network tools are impossible** — IP lookup, DNS lookup, WHOIS, UTM builder are all Hard KD without exception. Established players (MXToolbox, ICANN, Google Campaign URL Builder) own these completely.

5. **Discount calculators are a niche win** — Double and triple discount calculators are Easy KD with >100 volume. Very specific long-tail keywords that bigger sites don't target.

### Formula update from Round 3:
**Fee calculators targeting specific platforms** (Stripe, Etsy, eBay) are a new winning pattern — platform-specific tools have lower competition than generic tools.

### Hit rate comparison:
- Round 1: 36% (18/50 keywords)
- Round 2: 36% (23/64 keywords)
- Round 3: 31% (10/32 keywords)

Slight decline confirms we're moving into harder territory. The easiest wins have been captured in earlier rounds.

## METHODOLOGY

**Tool:** Ahrefs Free Keyword Generator (ahrefs.com/keyword-generator)
**Limitation:** Shows KD as Easy/Medium/Hard (not numeric 0-100), volume as ranges (>10,000, >1,000, >100, <100)
**Criteria:** Easy KD + >100 volume = BUILD, Hard KD = SKIP regardless of volume, Medium KD = SKIP unless exceptional
**Inspiration source:** goonlinetools.com — competitor tool site with 250+ tools across 13 categories
**Reddit validation:** r/SideProject post about 100+ tools site reaching 600K monthly users confirmed strategy
**Total keywords tested:** 32 across 2 rounds
**Hit rate:** 31% (10 winners from 32 tested)
**Research time:** ~20 minutes total (2 rounds × 10 min each)
